# Details on blast results

My job was in queue for a long time, but finished overnight. Unfortunately,
it appears an error occurred with the run-blast.sh code, as detailed in the
example std-err file in this folder.

I'm not certain whether it was a mistake I made copying or an issue with
the code itself, but it doesn't seem to be working as intended.
