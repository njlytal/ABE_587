# Details on blast results

My job was in queue for a long time, but finished overnight. Unfortunately,
it appears an error occurred with the run-blast.sh code, as detailed in the
example std-err file in this folder. It seems the last line is to blame,
though the file merely mentions the process being killed rather than anything
more specific.

I'm not certain whether it was a mistake I made copying or an issue with
the code itself, but it doesn't seem to be working as intended.
